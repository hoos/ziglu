            <h1>ZIGLU®&#39;s CUSTOMER TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
            <h2>v1.0.5 P0.1 May 2020</h2>
            <p>These terms and conditions and each of the documents we refer to in these terms and conditions form the
                contract between Ziglu Limited, trading as Ziglu® (“Ziglu®”, “we”, “us”, “our”) and you as our customer
                and part of the Ziglu® community (“you”, “your”) in relation to your Ziglu® account, the Ziglu® app and
                your use and our provision of related services, including currency exchange and e-wallet services (our
                “services”).</p>
            <p>When you apply for a Ziglu® account and when you use them or our services, you are deemed to agree to
                these terms and conditions, as well as the documents we refer to in these terms and conditions (such as,
                but not limited to, our Privacy Policy which is available separately via the Ziglu® app and on our
                website), as the same may be amended from time to time.</p>
            <p>For your own benefit and protection, you should read these terms and conditions and all documents
                referred to very carefully before using our services, your Ziglu® account and the Ziglu® app. If you do
                not understand any point or wish to have any further information regarding our services, please contact
                us and ask for further information using the details provided below (see <strong>section 14</strong>).
                We suggest that you print a copy of these terms and conditions and our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>By applying for and using our services you agree and represent that you are using the same only for
                yourself as an individual in your personal capacity and not on behalf of any other person or entity or
                for commercial trading. You are also agreeing irrevocably that you are responsible for all activity that
                occurs on your Ziglu® account and via your mobile device connected with/to your Ziglu® account. You must
                not allow any third party to make use of our services at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: Cryptocurrency is extremely volatile. The risk of loss in trading or holding digital
                    currencies and cryptocurrencies can be substantial. As with any asset, the value of digital
                    currencies and cryptocurrencies can go up or down (and can even drop to zero), may be very volatile
                    and there can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying, selling, holding, or investing in
                    digital currencies and cryptocurrencies. Digital currency and cryptocurrency services are not
                    currently regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority or any other regulator in the UK. You should
                    carefully consider whether trading or holding digital currencies or cryptocurrencies is suitable for
                    you in light of your own financial situation and attitude to risk, as evaluated by you carefully. We
                    do not make any representations or recommendations regarding the advisability or otherwise of
                    trading in digital currencies and cryptocurrencies or any particular transaction. We cannot and do
                    not guarantee the timeliness, accuracy or completeness of any information (whether pricing, exchange
                    rate or otherwise) provided in connection with any digital currency or cryptocurrency or your
                    holding or trading of or in the same. PLEASE ALSO NOTE: None of our services and none of the
                    currencies you may hold are currently subject to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or any
                    other regulatory or safeguarding protections and there is currently no recourse for you to the
                    Financial Ombudsman Service. All value will remain in an unregulated and unprotected environment,
                    outside the scope of the Financial Conduct Authority.</strong></p>
            <h2>1. ABOUT ZIGLU®</h2>
            <p>Ziglu® is the trading name of Ziglu Limited, a private company limited by shares incorporated and
                registered in England and Wales with company number 9204810 and whose registered office is at 1 Poultry,
                London, EC2R 8EJ.</p>
            <h2>2. OUR SERVICES</h2>
            <p>Once approved, your Ziglu® account will be one (or more) hosted digital wallet(s) enabling you to store,
                track and manage your balance of GBP funds loaded by you into your Ziglu® account, any cryptocurrency
                and digital currency balances held on your behalf and to make use of the services provided by or on
                behalf of Ziglu® enabling you to:</p>
            <p>1. load GBP into your Ziglu® account;</p>
            <p>2. exchange loaded GBP funds for certain digital currencies and cryptocurrencies to which we provide
                access via our approved exchanges;</p>
            <p>3. exchange digital currency and cryptocurrency for GBP;</p>
            <p>4. exchange one digital currency or cryptocurrency for another;</p>
            <p>5. withdraw GBP from your Ziglu® account to the original bank account used to load GBP funds initially;
                and</p>
            <p>6. view details of your transactions and balances and manage your Ziglu® account.</p>
            <p>Please see sections 4 and 5 for more details.</p>
            <p>When you load GBP to your Ziglu® account, we will arrange for it to be held for you. This is not the same
                as a bank holding money for you as we cannot and will not use your GBP funds to invest or lend to other
                persons or entities and your GBP funds will not earn or accrue any interest. In addition, the GBP funds
                you load into your Ziglu® account are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or any
                other regulatory or safeguarding protections. Your GBP funds will be held in one or more bank accounts
                <strong>separately</strong> from our own funds and will not be commingled with our own monies/funds.</p>
            <h2>3. ELIGIBILITY FOR A ZIGLU® ACCOUNT</h2>
            <p>Ziglu®’s services and any Ziglu® account and the Ziglu® app are currently only for use by residents of
                the United Kingdom who are aged 18 and over. While we intend to expand our offerings to other countries
                in due course, currently only UK-residents who are at least 18 years of age may use our services and are
                eligible to apply for a Ziglu® account.</p>
            <p>You will also need a current bank account with a PRA-regulated UK bank in order to be able to load GBP
                (pounds sterling) (&quot;GBP&quot;) into your Ziglu® account.</p>
            <p>In order for us to approve you for a Ziglu® account and provide you with our services, we will need to
                verify your identity and run due diligence checks to ensure both that you are who you say you are and
                that we avoid any risk of your Ziglu® account, our services or the Ziglu® app being used for illegal
                purposes (such as money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud or any other financial crime). You will
                need to complete these verification procedures before you will be able to access the full benefits of
                your Ziglu® account, our services and the Ziglu® app.</p>
            <p>The information we request may include certain personal information, including, but not limited to: your
                name; residential address; prior residential addresses; telephone number; email address; date of birth;
                information regarding your bank account from which you wish to load money to your Ziglu® account (such
                as the name of the bank, the account type, sort code and bank account details, etc.); mobile device
                identifiers (that uniquely identify your device for security purposes) and other details we may
                reasonably require.</p>
            <p>We may also ask for further information from time to time in line with our internal policies and
                regulatory requirements, which themselves may change from time to time, and you must provide us with all
                requested information and inform us of any changes to any information provided. We will treat all of
                this information in accordance with our data protection obligations and applicable law, including in
                accordance with our Privacy Policy, which is available via our Ziglu® app and on our website.</p>
            <p>By applying for a Ziglu® account and to receive our services, you authorise us to make such enquiries as
                we deem appropriate, whether directly or via third parties, in order to seek to verify your identity,
                the information and documentation you provide, to protect you and us against fraud or other financial
                crime and to take such action as we reasonably deem appropriate based on the results of such enquiries
                and our ongoing legal and regulatory obligations. You therefore acknowledge and agree that your personal
                information may be disclosed to third party enquiry and verification agents acting for us, to credit
                reference, fraud prevention and financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our
                enquiries in full.</p>
            <p>Such checks may require a period of delay prior to authorising your Ziglu® account or authorising any
                particular use of our services, including any transaction or series of transactions. You accept and
                acknowledge that our obligations are ongoing throughout the term of your use of our services, your
                Ziglu® account and the Ziglu® app and, as such, we may be obliged to repeat checks and verification or
                to carry out additional or enhanced due diligence depending upon circumstances which arise (which may
                include, but are not limited to, situations where transaction volume, value or discrepancy gives rise to
                our need or decision to carry out the same) and that your continued use of our services, your Ziglu®
                account and the Ziglu® app is contingent on these checks being satisfied.</p>
            <p>We may store all the information about you and your transactions while you are our customer and for 6
                years after your Ziglu® account is closed.</p>
            <h2>4. GETTING STARTED</h2>
            <p>Where your application is successful and we have completed all relevant checks (and subject to your
                ongoing compliance at all times with these terms and conditions as amended from time to time), we will
                provide you with your Ziglu® account consisting of a hosted digital wallet reflecting the GBP funds
                loaded by you into your Ziglu® account (your <strong>“e-wallet”</strong>) and another to store, track,
                transfer and manage your balances of certain supported digital currencies and cryptocurrencies to which
                we allow access (your <strong>“Crypto e-wallet”</strong>).</p>
            <p>You may use your GBP funds to buy digital currency or cryptocurrency via the Ziglu® app, subject to
                having sufficient funds to do so. Similarly, you may elect to sell digital currency or cryptocurrency
                and receive GBP as a result or to exchange an amount of one digital currency or cryptocurrency for
                another.</p>
            <p>We will keep reasonable records of the funds you hold in your e-wallet and Crypto e-wallet and of your
                transactions using the same.</p>
            <p>If, for any reason, any e-wallet or Crypto e-wallet goes into negative balance, you must immediately
                repay such negative balance by loading sufficient funds into that e-wallet or transferring funds from
                another e-wallet you hold with Ziglu® to bring it back to at least a zero balance. We reserve the right
                to automatically offset any negative balance against any fund transfers you make or fund values you hold
                in any other e-wallet you have with Ziglu®.</p>
            <p>In order to get started, you will have to load GBP funds into your Ziglu® account using the details
                available via the Ziglu® app and one of our approved payment methods, which may include methods such as
                a credit or debit card or Apple, Android or Google Pay (as and when available). Your Ziglu® account will
                show loaded GBP funds once we have received them.</p>
            <p>When GBP funds are loaded to your Ziglu® account, your e-wallet will be updated with the relevant amount
                of GBP funds received. We will arrange for the GBP funds you have loaded to be held in a separate bank
                account with a regulated financial institution. The GBP funds you load will not earn any interest and
                nor will you have any entitlement to any interest on GBP funds held by us in the separate account. Your
                Ziglu® account may hold balances in different currencies which we make available via the Ziglu® app and
                we will show the balance for each currency you hold via the Ziglu® app.</p>
            <p><strong>Please note: You may not hold more than one Ziglu® account at any time. If you open or attempt to
                    open more than one Ziglu® account, any additional account may be suspended or closed at any time by
                    us without prior notice to you.</strong></p>
            <h2>5. EXCHANGING CURRENCIES</h2>
            <p>You may use your GBP funds held in your e-wallets to make any “Exchange Transaction” in crypto or digital
                currencies (“<strong>Assets</strong>”) via the Ziglu® app, subject to having sufficient funds to do so.
                An “<strong>Exchange Transaction</strong>” is when an Asset is acquired or disposed of for GBP, or where
                one Asset is exchanged for another Asset.</p>
            <p>We will provide Exchange Transactions using the best rate provided by the relevant exchanges with which
                we deal. We will be reviewing the exchanges with which we partner on a regular basis and adding or
                removing exchanges as we deem it appropriate to do so in order to try to maximise access to best prices
                for our customers.</p>
            <p>You must always be aware that when you confirm an Exchange Transaction, you will be giving an irrevocable
                instruction to us to transact on your behalf and you cannot cancel such instruction or that Exchange
                Transaction once you have pressed the &quot;Exchange now&quot; button on the Ziglu® app.</p>
            <p><strong>You must therefore ensure that you are certain you wish to proceed before you confirm any
                    Exchange Transaction.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>We do not provide investment advice</strong></p>
            <p>Offering access to any particular Asset via the Ziglu® app does not in any way, nor shall it be deemed
                to, indicate approval or disapproval by us of such Asset or any technology relating to it and should not
                be used as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each Asset. We make no
                warranty, guarantee or representation regarding the suitability or otherwise of any Asset to which
                access is offered by us through our services and we assume no fiduciary duty in our relationship with
                you to the extent permitted under applicable law. You must be aware at all times that there is always
                the risk of an Asset having a total loss of value, should the market for that Asset disappear.</p>
            <p>It is solely your responsibility to choose whether or not to proceed with any Exchange Transaction. We do
                not provide investment advice or advice of any other kind in connection with any Exchange Transaction.
                While we will provide indicative exchange rate information and may provide aggregated data on trends via
                the Ziglu® app, this does not constitute advice by us of any kind and nor are we making any form of
                recommendation. Any information we provide is purely for your personal use and should not be shared with
                others.</p>
            <p>You cannot and should not rely on any information provided by us (whether directly by us or via the
                Ziglu® app) when making your decision to proceed (or not) with any particular Exchange Transaction. You
                must only make such decisions based on your own determination of the merits of the transaction.</p>
            <p><strong>If you are unsure as to whether any Exchange Transaction is suitable for you and your
                    circumstances, you should take independent expert advice from a suitable adviser.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>We do not guarantee exchange rates</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Please note that we cannot guarantee the exchange rate used for any trade, because the actual
                    exchange rate applicable to any Exchange Transaction is not controlled by Ziglu® as it is a live,
                    market-based rate which is wholly dependent upon the rates offered on an ever-fluid and changing
                    basis by the relevant third-party exchanges handling your transactions.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>As such, the actual exchange rate achieved could be higher or lower than or the same as the
                    indicative rate, depending entirely upon market circumstances and the rates available to us from our
                    partners and the relevant exchanges. This means you may receive the same amount of Assets or GBP
                    funds as is indicated on the Ziglu® app following the exchange, but also it could be more or less
                    than that amount. Please also see the General risks – Exchange Rate Risk section below.</strong></p>
            <h2>The process for trading Assets</h2>
            <p>To instruct us to buy, sell or exchange any Assets you hold, you must follow the relevant instructions
                and steps shown in the Ziglu® app and nominate which funds or Assets you wish to use to effect the
                Exchange Transaction. You will be asked to confirm the amount of funds or Assets from your relevant
                e-wallet that you wish to use to effect the Exchange Transaction and will be shown an indicative
                exchange rate, which is <strong>not</strong> guaranteed.</p>
            <p>Once you have hit the &quot;Exchange now&quot; button in the Ziglu® app, your instruction to us to sell
                or purchase the relevant Assets is irrevocable and you cannot withdraw your consent to the Exchange
                Transaction.</p>
            <p>You should only undertake an Exchange Transaction where you have sufficient funds and Assets in your
                e-wallets to enable the transaction. If you do not, we may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>refuse to process any Exchange Transaction;</li>
                <li>cancel any Exchange Transactions for which you do not possess sufficient funds and/or Assets in your
                    e-wallets; and / or</li>
                <li>undertake the Exchange Transaction and freeze your Ziglu® account until any shortfall in funds is
                    paid by you; and</li>
                <li>we shall have no liability to you as a result of any such refusal or action taken (and in the event
                    we undertake the trade, you shall be liable to us for any resulting negative balance, on which see
                    <strong>section 11</strong>).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Title to Assets</h2>
            <p>You bear all risk of loss of value to your Assets and Ziglu® shall not be liable to you in any way for
                fluctuations in the value of your Assets.</p>
            <p>You may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise create security interests over or in relation to any
                Assets or our services. You must not try to grant any such security or agree to grant any such security
                or allow any third party to take any such security, and you may not grant anyone else any rights in or
                over the same.</p>
            <h2>How we hold Assets</h2>
            <p>All Assets are held in custody by us on your behalf. This means that Ziglu® holds legal title to the
                Assets on trust for you as a bare trustee. We do not owe you any fiduciary duties, except as required by
                applicable law. Assets are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</p>
            <p>We may, via our partners, custody Assets in cold storage on a pooled basis and we shall have no
                obligation to segregate any Assets held in relation to you and our other customers. Cold storage is a
                way of holding Assets such that they are not connected to the internet, and as such it is a relatively
                more secure way of holding Assets that minimises the risks of them being subject to a hack or
                cyberattack. The cold storage solution we select will be backed by insurance policies provided by or via
                our partners from third-party insurance underwriters. These policies insure against theft of Assets as a
                result of external hacking or security breaches, employee theft or fraudulent transfers. These policies
                do <strong>not</strong> cover any losses caused by any unauthorised access to your Ziglu® account. You
                <strong>must</strong> ensure that you keep all of your login passwords and details confidential and
                secure and that you do not allow any third party to access or use your Ziglu® account.</p>
            <h2>Exchange Transaction Limits</h2>
            <p>We may impose limits on the value and/or volume of Exchange Transactions which may be carried out by you,
                whether in respect of any particular Asset or group of Assets.</p>
            <p>Initially, you will only be able to exchange currency in amounts of that currency which exceed the
                minimum threshold limits we set for that currency in respect of each individual exchange transaction.
                These are as follows:</p>
            <p>Exchanging GBP into another currency - £0.01</p>
            <p>Exchanging Bitcoin (BTC) into another currency – 0.0001 BTC</p>
            <p>Exchanging Bitcoin Cash (BCH) into another currency – 0.01 BCH</p>
            <p>Exchanging Litecoin (LTC) into another currency – 0.01 LTC</p>
            <p>Exchanging Ether (Eth) into another currency - 0.01 Eth</p>
            <p>These limits will also be displayed in your Ziglu® account via the Ziglu® app or notified to you by email
                from time to time.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our absolute discretion, to change applicable limits as we deem appropriate or
                necessary. If you wish to increase any limits, please contact us using the details set out in
                <strong>section 14</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: If you retain less than the minimum threshold limit of a digital or crypto currency
                    set out above in your account, you will not be able to effect any exchange transaction using that
                    currency until you have topped up the total amount you hold in that currency so that your exchange
                    transaction exceeds the minimum threshold limit.</strong></p>
            <h2>General risks</h2>
            <p>Please note carefully that there are significant risks in using our services. Please read the below risks
                very carefully and contact us if there is anything you do not understand. In using our services, you
                acknowledge that you accept the below risks and that, whilst we will act in good faith to try to prevent
                them from materialising, we are not liable in the event that they do materialise.</p>
            <h2>Exchange Rate Risk</h2>
            <p><strong>You accept and acknowledge that each purchase, sale and/or exchange of Assets is subject to an
                    exchange rate, being the price of the relevant Asset in fiat currency or the equivalent rate of
                    exchange of another Asset. The rates we display via the Ziglu® app are indicative rates, only, and
                    ARE NOT GUARANTEED to be the rates you will actually receive.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The actual exchange rate applicable to any Exchange Transaction is not controlled by Ziglu® as it
                    is a live, market-based rate which is wholly dependent upon the rates offered on an ever-fluid and
                    changing basis by the relevant third-party exchanges handling your Exchange Transactions. As such,
                    the actual exchange rate achieved could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the indicative
                    rate, depending entirely upon market circumstances and the rates available to us from our partners
                    and the relevant exchanges. This means you may receive the same amount of currency and/or Assets (as
                    applicable) as is indicated on the Ziglu® app following an Exchange Transaction but it could also be
                    more or less than that amount.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Whilst Ziglu® seeks to achieve the best rates for you which are available via its arrangements
                    with its partners and the relevant exchanges, the actual exchange rate achieved for each Exchange
                    Transaction will only be confirmed to you and displayed to you via the Ziglu® app once the Exchange
                    Transaction has been completed.</strong></p>
            <h2>Operational risks</h2>
            <p>You must also be aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges, as we or our partners may
                experience unexpected surges in activity or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause
                interruptions to our services and may lead to delays. You agree to accept the risk of Exchange
                Transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties.</p>
            <h2>Glitches and maintenance</h2>
            <p>There is an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories we use could contain
                weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs, which could make aspects of our services unavailable from time to
                time. This may also happen if our services need to undergo maintenance, or whilst they are upgraded.</p>
            <h2>Counterparty risk</h2>
            <p>The ability for you to purchase or sell Assets via the Ziglu® app is contingent on there being a
                counter-party willing to sell or purchase the same, which is wholly outside of our control. We make no
                promises as to the timing or availability of the ability to purchase or sell Assets via the Ziglu® app,
                as we simply cannot control this.</p>
            <h2>Cyberattacks and hacking risks</h2>
            <p>Ziglu® or our partners or exchanges may be subject to cyberattacks and attempted hacks. Whilst we have in
                place systems and controls to help prevent these in relation to Ziglu®, such attacks may be successful
                and lead to loss of Assets, loss of funds, loss of data and in our systems becoming temporarily
                unavailable.</p>
            <h2>Viruses</h2>
            <p>To our knowledge, we will not provide you with software which contains any malicious code, program, or
                other internal component (e.g. computer virus, computer worm, computer time bomb, or similar component)
                (all together, a <strong>“Virus”</strong>), however you accept that the nature of our services means
                inherently there is a risk of software containing a Virus. As such, by using our services you agree to
                act reasonably in performing your own checks for a potential Virus and to provide us with reasonable
                assistance in identifying and remedying any Virus. To the extent that you interact with software
                provided by or on behalf of a third party, you accept that we cannot check such software for a Virus
                and, as such, we cannot take responsibility for checking any such software.</p>
            <h2>Other risks</h2>
            <p>Please note that there may be other risks in addition to those outlined above and below in relation to
                your holding or participating in Assets and there may be further risks that arise in the future.</p>
            <h2>Risks specific to Assets</h2>
            <p><strong>In addition to the risks above, trading in the Assets can be extremely risky and can lead to
                    substantial losses. Each Asset has unique features which may make it more or less likely to
                    fluctuate in value. Prices of Assets offered via the Ziglu® app can be extremely volatile, and
                    Ziglu® has no control over these prices. By trading in Assets, you confirm that you understand the
                    risks involved in trading in this asset class, and that you have suitable trading experience and
                    risk tolerance for trading in this asset class. You should never trade more than you can afford to
                    lose, and you should be aware that the value of Assets can drop to nothing.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You should carefully consider whether trading or holding Assets is suitable for you in light of
                    your own financial situation and attitude to risk, as evaluated by you carefully. We do not make any
                    representations or recommendations regarding the advisability or otherwise of trading in Assets or
                    any particular Exchange Transaction. We cannot and do not guarantee the timeliness, accuracy or
                    completeness of any information (whether pricing, exchange rate or otherwise) provided in connection
                    with any Assets or your holding or trading of or in the same.</strong></p>
            <p>We set out some of the specific risks relating to Assets below and you should consider factors such as
                market liquidity for a particular Asset as well as other types of Assets, potential regulatory changes,
                market manipulation and price volatility. Trading in Assets is susceptible to large value decreases
                based on sudden losses of confidence by market participants, which can lead to significant surpluses of
                supply over demand (leading to a sharp fall in value). As Assets are digital in nature, they are
                susceptible to attacks from hackers, insecurity of technical systems within the market and governmental
                changes in attitude towards Assets (or a particular Asset) ,which can also seriously adversely affect
                and reduce the value of any Assets. Ziglu® has no control over this.</p>
            <h2>Cyberattacks</h2>
            <p>Blockchain networks may be subject to attacks by third parties and we do not have any ability to prevent
                or mitigate such attacks. We reserve the right to take the following commercially reasonable actions in
                the event of an attack: (a) if we are able to confirm that an Asset active on our Ziglu® app has been
                compromised or is under attack, we may immediately halt trading and Exchange Transactions relating to
                that Asset; (b) if it is determined that such an attack has caused an Asset to greatly decrease in
                value, we may discontinue trade activity in such Asset entirely. To be clear, we do not have any
                obligation to engage in any activity in response to an attack on a blockchain network.</p>
            <h2>Software protocols</h2>
            <p>You must also be aware and accept that the software protocols that underlie Assets are often open source
                projects, which means that the development and control of such Assets is entirely outside our control
                and anyone can use, copy, modify and distribute them. We are not responsible for the operation of
                software protocols and we cannot guarantee their functionality, security, or ongoing availability, which
                in turn might have a significant impact on the availability, usability or value of a given Asset.</p>
            <h2>Forks</h2>
            <p><strong>Under no circumstances should you deal in a particular Asset in reliance upon a Fork (as defined
                    below) happening or under the assumption a Fork (as defined below) will increase the value of your
                    Assets and that we will support it.</strong></p>
            <p>As a result of the decentralised and open source nature of Assets it is possible that sudden, unexpected,
                or controversial changes may be made to an Asset that may change the usability, functions, value or even
                name of a given Asset (<strong>“Forks”</strong>). Such Forks may result in multiple versions of an Asset
                and could lead to the dominance of one or more such versions of an Asset and the partial or total
                abandonment or loss of value of any other versions of such Asset, and this can lead to loss of value in
                any Assets and/or other Assets we hold on your behalf.</p>
            <p>Whether or not any Fork relating to an Asset is recognised or accommodated by any Asset exchange is
                entirely a matter for the relevant exchange and we have no control over this. As Forks can be frequent,
                contentious and unpredictable they cannot be consistently supported by us when holding Assets for you.
                You must therefore never operate under the assumption that we will support any Fork of an Asset. We are
                under no obligation to support any Fork, whether or not any resulting version of such forked Assets has
                dominance or holds or increases in value at the time of or following such Fork.</p>
            <p>If we elect, acting in our sole discretion, to support a Fork, we will make a public announcement through
                the Ziglu® app and/or by notifying customers via email. We will not, however, bear any liability for any
                real or potential losses that may result based on our decision to support such Fork or the timing of
                implementation of support. If we, in our sole discretion, do not elect to support a Fork of an Asset,
                whether dominant or not, we will not have any responsibility or liability whatsoever for any losses or
                other issues that might arise from such unsupported Fork of an Asset.</p>
            <p>Note that in the event of a Fork of an Asset, we may be forced to suspend all activities and Exchange
                Transactions relating to such Asset for an extended period of time until we have been able to determine,
                in our sole discretion, that such functionality can be restored. This suspension will likely occur
                immediately upon a Fork of a given Asset, potentially with little or no warning, and during this period
                of suspension you will not be able to purchase or sell the Asset which is subject to such Fork.</p>
            <h2>Airdrops</h2>
            <p>Ziglu® also does not generally support any distributions, dividends or “airdrops” of Assets to wallet
                addresses (collectively, <strong>“Airdrops”</strong>) regardless of whether or not you would have
                received such Airdrops had you held such Assets outside of your Ziglu® account.</p>
            <p>We may, at our sole discretion, elect to distribute and/or support an Airdrop, but we have no obligation
                to do so and shall bear no liability to you for failing to do so. If we do not support an Airdrop, we
                will not claim such Airdrop for our own benefit (unless it is unavoidable or impractical to avoid based
                on the means of distribution).</p>
            <h2>Legislative and regulatory changes</h2>
            <p>The regulation of Assets is developing and may rapidly evolve. Regulation is subject to significant
                uncertainty and regulators may in the future adopt laws, regulations, guidance or other actions that may
                severely impact the use, transfer, exchange and value of Assets significantly and may even lead to total
                loss of value.</p>
            <p>In addition, there is a regulatory risk that the law changes so that our services relating to Assets
                become regulated activities, requiring us to obtain regulatory authorisation or approval in order to
                continue to provide those services. If we become required to obtain such approval, there is a risk that
                we may not be able to obtain it, either within a reasonable time period or at all, and the consequence
                of this will be to restrict our ability to offer our full range of services.</p>
            <h2>Exchange risks</h2>
            <p>There are risks when dealing with crypto exchanges, for example they may be hacked, may face solvency
                issues, may be the subject of fraud or may be negligent in carrying out Exchange Transactions. In
                addition, an exchange may reject any Exchange Transaction or the provision of any Assets by us for any
                or no reason. We seek to deal with reputable and reliable exchanges but we simply cannot mitigate this
                risk entirely for you. You accept that where we deal with an exchange, any such dealings will be subject
                to the risks relating to that exchange.</p>
            <h2>Loss of Assets held in custody</h2>
            <p>Whilst we use an insured custody solution to try to protect your Assets, there is a risk that the
                custodian(s) we use are hacked or lose your Assets, or that a third party misappropriates your Assets
                and the insurance pay-out does not cover the resulting loss. Where insurance is available, this may also
                only be on a ‘pooled’ basis such that the cover available is shared between all users of a particular
                custody solution, meaning that not all losses may be covered.</p>
            <h2>6. WHAT DO WE CHARGE?</h2>
            <p>We believe everything should be as simple and transparent for you as possible, without any hidden charges
                or additional fees you don’t know about up front. As such, we charge a simple fixed percentage fee on
                Exchange Transactions (as defined below) calculated by reference to the relevant value of each Exchange
                Transaction when it happens.</p>
            <p>An ‘Exchange Transaction’ happens when: (i) GBP is exchanged for Assets; or (ii) when the reverse
                happens; or (iii) one when an amount of one Asset is exchanged for another.</p>
            <p>The value of the Exchange Transaction will be: (i) the amount of GBP exchanged for Assets where they are
                being purchased; or (ii) the aggregate amount of Assets exchanged for GBP where Assets are being sold;
                or (iii) the aggregate amount of the relevant Assets exchanged where they are being used to purchase
                other Assets.</p>
            <p>Our fixed percentage fee will be <strong>one and a quarter percent (1.25%)</strong> of the relevant value
                of each Exchange Transaction when it happens, calculated as mentioned above.</p>
            <h2>Deduction of fees</h2>
            <p>We deduct our fees from your Ziglu® account at the time of effecting the Exchange Transaction (in
                relation to trading). In the event that there are insufficient funds in your Ziglu® account to satisfy
                our fee, we may refuse to effect an Exchange Transaction until such time as sufficient funds have been
                deposited into your Ziglu® account to enable it to proceed and our fee to be paid. Such delay may impact
                on the rate of exchange achieved for such Exchange Transaction and this could lead to losses on your
                part, which you hereby irrevocably accept and agree.</p>
            <h2>7. WITHDRAWING FUNDS FROM YOUR ZIGLU® ACCOUNT</h2>
            <p>You may withdraw funds, in GBP only, at any time by following the instructions in the Ziglu® app, and
                subject to you having enough funds available to meet the withdrawal request. You may only withdraw funds
                up to the amount actually held by you. Upon requesting a withdrawal, the funds will be transferred to
                your nominated bank account registered with us and approved by us for this purpose.</p>
            <p>You may not withdraw funds directly from your Crypto e-wallet or in any currency other than GBP. Should
                you wish to withdraw any such funds, you will have to issue an instruction to sell the relevant Assets
                for GBP within the e-wallet, from where it can then be withdrawn (this will be an Exchange Transaction
                and will be subject to our fees, as set out in <strong>section 6</strong>). Again, you should follow the
                instructions in the Ziglu® app in order to do this.</p>
            <h2>8. REPORTING ISSUES WITH YOUR ZIGLU® ACCOUNT</h2>
            <p>If you believe that any transaction on your Ziglu® account was not authorised by you or your MOBIL device
                or was not correctly carried out by us then you must notify us without delay as soon as you become aware
                of it, but in any event by not later than 13 months after the date of the unauthorised or incorrect
                transaction or when you became aware of it, by emailing us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="620a070e1222180b050e174c0b0d">[email&#160;protected]</a> or by calling +44 (0) 203
                901 8605 (our 24 hour automated reporting service – standard network charges will apply to your call).
            </p>
            <p>Where we have executed a transaction or payment which you or your mobile device have not authorised, we
                will refund the amount of the unauthorised payment unless: you have acted fraudulently; or you have
                deliberately failed to keep your security details safe or have been grossly negligent in keeping your
                security details safe.</p>
            <h2>9. SUSPENDING YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
            <p>We may suspend your ability to use our services at any time:</p>
            <p>1. for security, legal or regulatory reasons; or</p>
            <p>2. if we reasonably suspect your Ziglu® account or any of our services has been or is being used without
                your authorisation or fraudulently (this will include, but is not limited to, where you notify us that
                your security or Ziglu® account details may have been compromised or disclosed to or accessed by third
                parties).</p>
            <p>Unless it would compromise reasonable security measures or it would be unlawful, we will inform you by
                email, telephone or through the Ziglu® app of any suspension of your ability to make payments and our
                reasons for doing so. Where we are unable to tell you beforehand, we will tell you immediately
                afterwards unless it would compromise reasonable security measures or it would be unlawful.</p>
            <p>We may also at any time suspend your ability to undertake Exchange Transactions if:</p>
            <p>1. we are required to take such action by any regulatory body;</p>
            <p>2. you breach any part of these terms and conditions (including any document we refer to in them);</p>
            <p>3. you breach, or we have reason to believe that you are in breach of, any legal obligation, law or
                regulation that is applicable to your use of our services;</p>
            <p>4. we reasonably believe that we need to do so in order to protect our reputation;</p>
            <p>5. there is continued inactivity in relation to your Ziglu® account;</p>
            <p>6. you fail to respond to customer support requests;</p>
            <p>7. we are unable to satisfactorily verify your identity and/or complete any required due diligence
                checks;</p>
            <p>8. we have reason to believe or to suspect that you are in any way involved in any fraudulent activity,
                money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crime, or you are in any other way in breach of
                applicable law;</p>
            <p>9. we have reason to believe that there has been, or there is a potential, security breach; or</p>
            <p>10. it is reasonably necessary for us to do so to prevent you or us from breaching any applicable law or
                regulatory requirement.</p>
            <p>We may also block, cancel, refuse to complete and / or reverse an Exchange Transaction which you or your
                device have authorised or which is attempted, where there are insufficient funds or Assets to effect the
                relevant Exchange Transaction(s) and to satisfy our fee(s), or if any related payment(s) into your
                account is or are declined.</p>
            <p>We will try to give you advance notice of any suspension. Where advance notice is not possible, we will
                provide you with notice as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Unless we are prevented by
                applicable law, regulation and / or a competent court, if we have them, we will try to provide you with
                details of the nature of the suspension, its anticipated duration and anything you have to do to remedy
                any error or circumstance which has led to the suspension. However, we are under no obligation to allow
                you to reinstate an Exchange Transaction at the same price or on the same terms as any suspended,
                rejected, blocked, cancelled or reversed Exchange Transaction.</p>
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, whilst your Ziglu® account is suspended you will no longer be able to access
                the Ziglu® app and our services.</p>
            <h2>10. KEEPING YOUR ZIGLU® ACCOUNT SECURE</h2>
            <p>In order to access your Ziglu® account via the Ziglu® app, you will be required to create or will be
                given security details, which may include a username and password and/or automatic or manual first or
                second factor verification via your mobile device or other similar verification means.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for keeping the mobile device via which you access the Ziglu® app and your Ziglu®
                account safe and secure and for ensuring that there is adequate security and control of any and all
                security details used to access or use our services at all times. You must take all reasonable steps to
                avoid the loss, theft or misuse of your mobile device and your security details and to ensure that your
                mobile device is appropriately encrypted, secured and password or passcode protected.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Ziglu® account will be ‘tied’ to the mobile device you use to set up your Ziglu® account and
                    you will not be able to access your Ziglu® account from any other device. This is to help ensure the
                    safety and security of your Ziglu® account. If you need to change your mobile device, please contact
                    us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="84ece1e8f4c4feede3e8f1aaedeb">[email&#160;protected]</a> and we will guide you through the process needed to make the switch to the new
                    device.</strong></p>
            <p>In the event that your mobile device or security details are lost or compromised, this may result in
                unauthorised access to the balances in your Ziglu® account and could lead to the loss or theft of your
                GBP funds or of Assets or the loss in value of Assets. It may also jeopardise the security of your
                linked bank account or bank card details.</p>
            <p>You must keep your security details safe and confidential at all times. We strongly recommend against you
                writing them down or otherwise making them visible to third parties. You should <strong>never</strong>
                keep security details or your PIN in the same place as your Ziglu® account details. You should never
                allow a third party to view your Ziglu® account details or allow them access to your Ziglu® account.
                This includes not allowing a third-party remote access to your mobile device when you are logged in to
                your Ziglu® account or where they may gain access to details relating to the same.</p>
            <p>We will never ask you for your IDs, passwords or authentication codes or to screen share or otherwise
                seek access to your mobile device or Ziglu® account. If you see anything suspicious in connection with
                your Ziglu® account or our services (including any unrecognised transactions) you should contact us
                immediately and notify us of the same in as much detail as possible.</p>
            <p>We strongly recommend you always make sure you fully close down the Ziglu® app each time you stop using
                it. You must always ensure that you download and install all updates for the Ziglu® app to your mobile
                device as soon as they become available, so that you have the latest version of the Ziglu® app
                available.</p>
            <p>You should also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing, phishing and other
                attacks and you must use care when reviewing messages purporting to come from Ziglu® to ensure that they
                do genuinely come from us, for example by checking that the email address they come from ends
                “@ziglu.network”.</p>
            <p>If you suspect that there has been any security breach or compromising of your security details or mobile
                device, you must notify us immediately via <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="620a070e1222180b050e174c0b0d">[email&#160;protected]</a> or by calling +44 (0) 203 901 8605 (our 24 hour
                automated reporting service – standard network charges will apply to your call) and provide all relevant
                details (including continuing to provide us with accurate and up to date information for the duration of
                any suspected breach or security issue). You must then take any steps we reasonably require to reduce,
                mitigate, manage or report such breach or suspected security breach or issue.</p>
            <h2>11. YOUR OBLIGATIONS</h2>
            <p>You must comply with your obligations as set out in these terms and conditions, including but not limited
                to obligations relating to security of your Ziglu® account, and you must at all times ensure that you
                comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using our services. We are not responsible for
                determining whether or which laws may apply to your transactions, including tax law. You are solely
                responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of our services.</p>
            <p>If, for any reason, any e-wallet goes into negative balance, you must immediately repay such negative
                balance by loading sufficient funds into that e-wallet or transferring funds from another e-wallet you
                hold with Ziglu® to bring it back to at least a zero balance. We reserve the right to automatically
                offset any negative balance against any fund transfers you make or fund values you hold in any other
                e-wallet you have with Ziglu®.</p>
            <p>You must not use, or allow to be used, your Ziglu® account, our services or any e-wallet to engage in any
                act, or by omission to commit, cause, facilitate or contribute to the commission by any person of
                anything, constituting or which could constitute a tax evasion offence or facilitation of tax evasion
                offence. A tax evasion offence includes cheating a public revenue authority or being knowingly concerned
                in, or in taking steps with a view to, the fraudulent evasion of tax and tax includes duties and social
                security contributions.</p>
            <p>You will not do or omit to do any act or thing which constitutes or may constitute an offence under
                anti-bribery law. Offences include:</p>
            <p>1. directly or indirectly offering, promising or giving any person working for or engaged by us a
                financial or other advantage to either induce that person to perform improperly a relevant function or
                activity; or reward that person for improper performance of a relevant function or activity;</p>
            <p>2. directly or indirectly requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting any financial or other advantage
                as an inducement or a reward for improper performance of a relevant function or activity in connection
                with these terms and conditions; and / or</p>
            <p>3. committing any other offence under applicable anti-bribery laws. The services we provide are personal
                to you and you must not assign or transfer any of them or your Ziglu® account to any third party without
                our express prior agreement in writing and subject to you complying with any conditions or requirements
                we may have which are related to such assignment or transfer.</p>
            <p>You cannot use our services for any of the following types of activity (please note that this list is not
                exhaustive and we may update or amend it from time to time at our absolute discretion):</p>
            <p>1. Any unlawful or immoral activity of any kind.</p>
            <p>2. Any abusive or detrimental activity which impacts adversely on our systems, infrastructure, personnel,
                our services, the operation of your or anyone else’s Ziglu® account or our business. This may include,
                but is not limited to, intercepting or expropriating any system, information or data or transmitting or
                uploading any virus, trojan horse, worm or other harmful or deleterious programs, code or software,
                attempting to access any Ziglu® or other account other than your own authorised Ziglu® account,
                attempting to transfer your Ziglu® account and/or access to it to a third party, and enabling third
                parties to access your Ziglu® account, the Ziglu® accounts of others and/or Ziglu®’s systems and
                services in an unauthorised manner.</p>
            <p>3. Any attempt to interfere with any other user’s access or use of their Ziglu® account, our services or
                the Ziglu® app or any attempt to abuse, discriminate against, threaten, extort, defame, harass or stalk
                or otherwise violate or infringe the rights of any third party.</p>
            <p>4. Gambling, whether in the form of lotteries, auctions (with or without bidding fees), betting, sports
                forecasting or odds making, fantasy sports leagues with cash prizes, internet gaming, contests,
                sweepstakes, games of chance or otherwise.</p>
            <p>5. Infringement of intellectual property rights, whether ours or any third party’s – this includes, but
                is not limited to, engaging in transactions which involve items which infringe such rights.</p>
            <p>6. Any business-related activity.</p>
            <p>7. Any unfair, deceptive or predatory activity towards any third party or anything which involves
                illegal, pornographic, defamatory or abusive content, products or materials.</p>
            <p>You shall as soon as reasonably practicable give us written notice upon a breach, or suspected breach, of
                any of your obligations under these terms and conditions, and on your becoming aware of any allegation,
                investigation, evidence or report relating to a breach or possible breach of any of the requirements
                relating to applicable legal and / or regulatory obligations.</p>
            <h2>12. OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITY TO YOU</h2>
            <p>Nothing in this section or these terms and conditions excludes our liability to you for death or personal
                injury caused by our negligence, for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by us or our agents or any
                other matter for which it would be illegal for us to exclude or attempt to exclude our liability.</p>
            <h2>Exchange Transactions and our services</h2>
            <p>We strive to provide you and all our other users and customers with an excellent, responsive service at
                all times. However, access to our services may become degraded or reduced, or even unavailable, during
                times of significant volatility or volume. This is a particular risk involved with Assets given that
                they, themselves, are prone to high volatility and sudden increases in volumes of dealing. We set out
                above in <strong>section 5</strong> the potential risks which may arise in relation to Exchange
                Transactions, and, so long as we have acted in good faith in attempting to mitigate these risks, we are
                not liable for any loss caused as a result of these risks.</p>
            <p>We cannot guarantee that our services will be available without interruption and we do not guarantee that
                any Exchange Transaction will be executed, accepted, recorded or remain open. We will not be responsible
                for losses you may incur as a result of this. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests
                for Exchange Transactions are processed in as timely a manner as is reasonably practicable but we cannot
                guarantee this and we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to
                complete processing, which is dependent upon a number of factors which are beyond our reasonable
                control.</p>
            <p>We will also not be liable to you for any issues or failures relating to carrying out Exchange
                Transactions where one or more of our exchange partners are unavailable or unable to process any
                requested transaction, there is not enough of a particular Asset available in the market to allow a
                transaction to proceed or where we refuse to carry out a request or instruction as we have good reason
                to believe it could adversely affect our reputation.</p>
            <p>We will also not be responsible for any losses you may suffer where monies are returned in relation to
                any Exchange Transaction which is cancelled or refunded, including but not limited to any losses arising
                as a result of the application of exchange rates on the return of such monies. Where monies are returned
                to us in a currency which is not the original currency we transferred, we will apply our then current
                exchange rate to exchange such currency received back into the original currency. This may result in
                more or less of the original currency being received as a result and we will not be liable to you for
                any loss caused to you as a result.</p>
            <p>While we try to be as responsive as possible, customer support times may also be delayed during times of
                high transaction volume or volatility, particularly in relation to non-critical issues (e.g. issues
                which don’t impact on the safety and security of our services, your Ziglu® account, Ziglu®’s systems or
                you personally).</p>
            <p>In addition, while we also strive to provide you with accurate information wherever possible, we cannot
                guarantee that it is complete and accurate at all times and in all respects and you must view it
                accordingly and should not act in reliance upon it. We do not accept liability for any information
                provided which is inaccurate or incomplete unless this is as a result of our fraud or fraudulent
                misrepresentation or the fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation of our agents.</p>
            <p>We are liable only for direct losses which are a reasonably foreseeable consequence of our failure to
                provide our services and we are not responsible for any loss of profits or savings or of anticipated
                profits or savings which arise from or could have arisen from any Exchange Transaction. Our liability
                for these losses will be limited to a maximum amount equal to the fees you have paid to us for our
                services and the Ziglu® account in the twelve months prior to the date of the issue giving rise to our
                liability.</p>
            <p>Ziglu® does not accept any liability for any loss of Assets you may suffer due to compromise of your
                security details or mobile device where this is not due to our fault and/or the loss results from your
                failure to follow the requirements set out in these terms and conditions. We also will not be
                responsible for any loss you may suffer which results from any failure by you to take action following
                any notice or alert from us to you.</p>
            <h2>Viruses</h2>
            <p>We are not liable for any damage or interruption caused by any computer viruses or other malicious code
                which might affect your mobile device or other equipment outside of our reasonable control, or any
                phishing, spoofing or other attack of any kind. We strongly recommend that you use a reputable and
                effective virus screening and prevention software package on all devices you use.</p>
            <h2>Unforeseen circumstances</h2>
            <p>We are not liable for any breach of our obligations under these terms and conditions where that breach is
                due to abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which would have
                been unavoidable despite all efforts to the contrary.</p>
            <p>We are also not liable for any breach of our obligations under these terms and conditions where the
                contravention is due to our obligations under applicable law.</p>
            <h2>13. HOW WE CONTACT YOU AND USE YOUR DATA</h2>
            <p>We collect and retain information about you so that we can operate your Ziglu® account. We may use third
                parties to process your personal information on our behalf.</p>
            <p>We and our affiliates are committed to maintaining your personal data in accordance with legal
                requirements relating to the collection, storage and use of personal data. Except as required by law, or
                in accordance with these terms and conditions and/or our Privacy Policy, which is available via the

                permission. By accepting these terms and conditions and using our services, your Ziglu® account and/or
                the Ziglu® app, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. You should print and keep a copy of our
                Privacy Policy together with these terms and conditions.</p>

                our Privacy Policy to be sent to you by post.</p>
            <p>If we suspect that we have been given false or inaccurate information, we may record and retain such
                suspicion together with any other relevant information.</p>
            <p>If we receive false or inaccurate information and we identify or reasonably suspect any fraud or other
                illegal activities, then we will pass details to fraud prevention agencies and/or other relevant
                agencies to prevent fraud, money laundering, financial crime, financing of terrorism and other illegal
                activities.</p>
            <p>We may check all personal information you give us with fraud prevention agencies and other organisations
                and we may obtain information about you from credit reference agencies to verify your identity.</p>
            <p>You must tell us by email (to our address: <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6c0409001c2c16050b0019420503">[email&#160;protected]</a>) as soon as possible of any changes to your
                name, postal address, telephone and email address so that our records are accurate, complete and up to
                date. You must provide any document that we request to confirm the changes.</p>
            <p>We will not be liable for any losses arising out of your failure to update us of any changes to your
                details.</p>
            <p>We may ask you at any time to confirm the accuracy of your information or to provide documents or other
                evidence to do so.</p>
            <h2>14. COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
            <p>All information and communications between us and you will be provided in English. We will communicate
                with you primarily by email or by posting information within the Ziglu® app. It is your responsibility
                to ensure that you are able to receive and send emails and have the required access to the Ziglu® app.
                In addition, you must ensure that the mobile device you use to access your Ziglu® account has the
                required minimum operating system version installed on it, in line with the guidance provided by Ziglu®,
                including via the Apple App Store, Google Play Store or any other app store or distribution platform via
                which we make the Ziglu® app available to you or as otherwise notified to you in the Ziglu® app or by
                email. If you fail to ensure the required minimum operating system version is installed on your mobile
                device, the Ziglu® app may not function properly and your Ziglu® account may not be accessible as a
                result, for which we will have no responsibility or liability to you.</p>
            <p>If you have any feedback, questions, issues or complaints, please do not hesitate to contact our Customer
                Support. Customer Support can be reached via the Ziglu® app or by email at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e68e838a96a69c8f818a93c88f89c8">[email&#160;protected]</a> You can also

                the call).</p>
            <p>We may monitor and/or record telephone calls we have with you to help us maintain and improve the quality
                of service and for fraud and crime prevention and detection purposes.</p>
            <h2>Complaints</h2>
            <p>If you do have a complaint regarding any matter, please do contact Customer Support, providing details
                around the cause of your complaint, how you would like the complaint to be resolved and any other
                information you believe may be relevant.</p>
            <p>All complaints will be investigated in accordance with our complaints procedure. A customer complaints
                officer will consider your complaint based on the information you have provided.</p>
            <p>Within 15 business days of the day on which we receive the complaint from you we will send a final
                response to you. However, if there are exceptional circumstances which are beyond our control, we may
                send you a holding response within that period, indicating the reasons for the delay, and provide a
                final response no later than 35 business days from receipt of the complaint. A business day for these
                purposes is any day other than Saturday or Sunday or a public or bank holiday in England.</p>
            <p>The response will: (i) offer to resolve your complaint in the way you had requested; or (ii) explain why
                your complaint has not been upheld; or (iii) offer to resolve your complaint in an alternative manner we
                deem reasonably appropriate. Any offer of resolution made to you will only become binding on us if it is
                accepted by you.</p>
            <p>This does not prevent you from taking legal proceedings. There is no recourse to the Financial Ombudsman
                Service as our services do not fall within their remit.</p>

                information about alternative dispute resolution which may be of interest to European Union persons and
                we are required to inform you that as you are such a consumer you may use it if there is a dispute that
                cannot be resolved between you and us.</p>

            <p>In the event that we detect that there has been no activity on your Ziglu® account for a prolonged period
                of time, we may suspend or ‘close’ your Ziglu® account until such time as you request in writing to us
                that it is reopened. At such time, we may require you to re-verify your identity. We may also be
                required by applicable law to report any funds held on your Ziglu® account as unclaimed property or to
                transfer them. If this is the case, we will endeavour to contact you at the contact details shown in our
                records.</p>

                arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter (including non-contractual disputes or
                claims) shall at all times be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and
                Wales. You and we hereby agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to

                matter (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</p>
            <h2>18. APP STORE TERMS</h2>
            <p>Please note that where you download the Ziglu® app from TestFlight, the Apple App Store, the Google Play
                Store or any other app store or distribution platform through which we may make the Ziglu® app
                available, these terms and conditions are solely between you and Ziglu® and not with TestFlight, Apple,
                Google or any other provider of any other app store or distribution platform. We, and not such provider,
                are solely responsible for the Ziglu® app and any issues or problems should be directed solely to us via
                the contact details in <strong>section 14</strong>.</p>
            <p>Your use of the Ziglu® app must comply with any relevant terms and conditions of the app store or
                distribution platform via which you download the Ziglu® app but the provider of the app store or
                distribution platform shall have no liability or obligation to you with respect to the Ziglu® app or
                these terms and conditions and you accept that the relevant provider is a third-party beneficiary of
                these terms and conditions.</p>
            <h2>19. TERMINATION AND VARIATION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
            <p>We will give you reasonable advance notice of any termination of or change to these terms and conditions
                or our fees. You will be treated as accepting any change that we make to these terms and conditions
                unless you tell us that you do not agree to the change, in which case you have the right to terminate
                these terms and conditions by giving us notice at any time before the change comes into effect. You will
                not be charged for terminating your agreement under these terms and conditions with us and closing your
                Ziglu® account, but you will still be required to pay any outstanding sums due to us.</p>
            <p>You may terminate your agreement with us under these terms and conditions without charge by giving us
                notice in writing at any time using the contact details set out in <strong>section 14</strong>. When
                your Ziglu® account is closed, any pending instructions and transactions will be cancelled with
                immediate effect, save as provided below.</p>
            <p>On closure of your Ziglu® account you will no longer be able to use your Ziglu® account but, unless
                prohibited by applicable law, by any court, or by any other order to which we are subject in any
                jurisdiction, for a period of 60 days following the date of termination, you will be permitted to effect
                Exchange Transactions which convert Assets into GBP for the purposes of then withdrawing this money from
                your Ziglu® account.</p>
            <p>Where your Ziglu® account holds a balance at the time of its closure, we will ask you to withdraw your
                GBP funds within a reasonable period of time, during which your Ziglu® account will be accessible for
                the purpose of withdrawing the remaining balance only. After the expiry of this period you will not be
                able to access your Ziglu® account but you may withdraw any remaining GBP funds for a period of six
                years from the date of closure of your Ziglu® account by contacting our customer service representatives
                and requesting that the funds be sent to you, by way of a bank transfer to the bank account used to
                create the Ziglu® account.</p>
            <p>We may require you to re-complete our identification and verification procedures in order to withdraw
                funds from your Ziglu® account upon or following closure.</p>
            <p>You may not close your Ziglu® account to evade or avoid an ongoing investigation. If you attempt to do
                so, we may freeze your Ziglu® account to protect you, us, our affiliates, or a third party against any
                liability. You will remain liable for any obligations in relation to your Ziglu® account even after it
                is closed.</p>
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if your Ziglu® account is closed, your access to our services will also be
                terminated.</p>
            <h2>20. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</h2>
            <p>We will always endeavour to act in your best interests as our customer and a member of our Ziglu®
                community. However, circumstances can arise where we or one of our other customers may have some form of
                interest in business being transacted for you. Examples where conflicts may arise include but are not
                limited to: (i) the value of any Assets we hold on your behalf being adversely affected (or reduced to
                zero) as a result of us processing transactions for other customers of Ziglu® on whose behalf we hold
                the same or different Assets; (ii) we may increase (by purchasing additional assets) or sell our own
                reserves of assets which may or may not adversely impact on the value of Assets held by Ziglu® on your
                behalf.</p>
            <p>If this happens or we become aware that our interests or those of one of our other customers appear to
                conflict with your interests, we will take appropriate steps to manage the conflict of interests fairly
                wherever possible. So long as we use reasonable commercial endeavours to manage potential conflicts, we
                will have no liability to you for any conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of our services
                or offerings, including but not limited to processing transactions for and on behalf of other customers
                and/or in relation to sales or purchases of the reserves we use to facilitate the operation of our
                business.</p>
            <h2>21. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
            <p>If any of these terms and conditions is found by a court or body or authority of competent jurisdiction
                to be illegal, unlawful, void or unenforceable, such term will be deemed to be severed from these terms
                and conditions and this will not affect the remainder of these terms and conditions which will continue
                in full force and effect.</p>
            <p>Subject to <strong>section 18</strong>, and unless and to the extent we agree otherwise in writing, a
                person who is not a party to these terms and conditions shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights
                of Third Parties) Act 1999, or otherwise, to enforce any of these terms or conditions.</p>
            <p>If we fail to enforce any of our rights under these terms and conditions, that does not mean we have
                waived any such rights. A waiver is only effective if we provide it in writing from one of our duly
                authorised representatives.</p>
            <p>These terms and conditions and the documents referred to in them constitute the entire agreement between
                you and us and supersede any prior agreement, terms and conditions or arrangement in respect of their
                subject matter. Except for the express statements set out in these terms and conditions, you hereby
                acknowledge and agree that you have not relied upon any other statement or understanding, whether
                written or oral, with respect to your use of and access to our services, your Ziglu® account and the
                Ziglu® app.</p>
            <p>Neither you nor Ziglu® have entered into these terms and conditions in reliance upon, and will have no
                remedy in respect of, any misrepresentation, representation or statement which is not expressly set out
                or referred to in these terms and conditions. The only remedy available for any misrepresentation or
                breach of any representation or statement set out or referred to in these terms and conditions shall be
                for breach of contract.</p>
